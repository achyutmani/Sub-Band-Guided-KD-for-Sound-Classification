# Sub-Band-Guided-KD-for-Sound-Classification
This work presentes training of a lightweight student model using multiple teacher models and knowledge distillation technique. The teacher models taks full-band and sub-band spectrogrms while learning of the teacher models. Further these models are employed and logits of these teacher models are aggregated with three different ensemble technique.
